# 📝 Professional Document Editor

A lightweight, modern document editor built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons.  
Designed for clean UI, responsive layouts, and intuitive text editing — perfect for a foundation in building professional writing or note-taking applications.

---

## 🚧 Constraints
- **No backend integration** — currently all edits are client-side only.
- **Basic formatting only** — limited to common toolbar actions (bold, italic, underline, lists, alignments).
- **No persistence** — refreshing the page clears content (no database or localStorage yet).
- **No collaboration features** — single-user editing only.

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs
- **Speed vs. Richness** — chose a minimal feature set to keep the app lightweight and fast.
- **No heavy editor libraries** — avoided tools like Draft.js or TipTap for simplicity and smaller bundle size.
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development instead of fully custom CSS — faster to build but less unique styling.
- **Lucide Icons** for clean, consistent icons without adding large asset packs.

## 🚀 How to Productionise
To make this production-ready:
1. **Add persistence** — connect to a database (e.g., Firebase, Supabase) or implement localStorage sync.
2. **Collaboration** — integrate WebSockets or WebRTC for real-time multi-user editing.
3. **Export & Import** — support formats like PDF, DOCX, and Markdown.
4. **Authentication** — allow users to log in and save personal documents.
5. **Advanced formatting** — headings, tables, images, custom themes.
6. **Testing & QA** — add unit and integration tests to ensure stability.
7. **Deployment** — host on Vercel/Netlify with CI/CD for seamless updates.
